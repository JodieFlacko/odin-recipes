#Odin Recipes Project

I started by creating an index.html file for my homepage.
I then added a links to other pages containing recipes. I created first the lasagna.html file, adding a header with the name of the dish, and a photo. Then, i added an unordered list for the ingredients, then an ordered list for the steps needed. I'm now creating a template .html file for new recipes; I should have done this before then creating lasagna.html.
